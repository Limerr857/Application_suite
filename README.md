# Application_Suite

This is a small collection of python applications for you to enjoy. 
Info about the individual projects below.

#### Image Of The Day (IOTD):
Presents an new image every day from the `image` folder. Use the folder already created or edit the source code and make your own!
The program supports most filetypes and a practically infinite amount of images. Images not in the 16:9 aspect ratio will be stretched or squished.

To add more images: copy the images you want to add into the `image` folder.

#### Calculat0r:
A simple calculator app. Mainly built as traing for more advanced stuff in the future.

#### Encrypt0r:
Encrypts messages using very simple methods, not really reliable scince you can brute-force your way trough most of it. Basically, do not use for anything other than fun.
Level 1, 2 and 3 uses basically the same method, only with slightly different degrees of security. Level 4 is different, but can still be brute-forced unless you use a MASSIVE key.

## Installation
To install simply download and uncompress the .zip file. After that, open `Application_suite.exe`.
If you want to update there are two options:
1. Delete the old files and reinstall everything.
2. Delete the .exe file and the .py files and reinstall those. (Might not always work,)

If you find ways of improving my applications, please leave an issue on my github.
