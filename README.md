# Application_Suite

This is a small collection of python applications for you to enjoy. 
Info about the individual projects below.

#### Image Of The Day (IOTD):
Presents an new image every day from the `image` folder. Use the folder already created or edit the source code and make your own!
The program supports most filetypes and a practically infinite amount of images. Images not in the 16:9 aspect ratio will be stretched or squished.

To add more images: copy the images you want to add into the `image` folder.

#### Calculat0r:
A simple calculator app. Mainly built as traing for more advanced stuff in the future.

#### Encrypt0r:
Encrypts messages using very simple methods, not really reliable scince you can brute-force your way trough most of it. Basically, do not use for anything other than fun.
Level 1, 2 and 3 uses basically the same method, only with slightly different degrees of security. Level 4 is different, but can still be brute-forced. New codes are generated every day for level 4, so do not wait too long to send your message!

To use:
1. Choose a security level, I recommend level 4.
2. Write or paste your message into the box, most characters are supported.
3. Write the key you want to use. The key can include all characters you can use to type a message in. You will need to send this key securely to your recipient.
4. Press "Encrypt" and copy the message that is presented. You might need to use the scrollbar.
5. When you get the encrypted message, follow the same steps as above.
## Installation
To install simply download and uncompress the .zip file. After that, open `Application_suite.exe`.
If you want to update there are two options:
- Delete the old files and reinstall everything.
- Delete the .exe file and the .py files and reinstall those. (Might not always work,)

If you find ways of improving my applications, please leave an issue on my github.
