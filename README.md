# Application_Suite

This is a small collection of python applications for you to enjoy. 
Info about the individual projects below.

#### Image Of The Day (IOTD):
Presents an new image every day from the `image` folder. Use the folder already created or edit the source code and make your own!
The program supports most filetypes and a practically infinite amount of images. Images not in the 16:9 aspect ratio will be stretched or squished.

To add more images: copy the images you want to add into the `image` folder.

#### Calculat0r:
A simple calculator app. Mainly built as traing for more advanced stuff in the future.

#### Encrypt0r:
Encrypts messages using very simple methods, not really reliable scince you can brute-force your way trough most of it. Basically, do not use for anything other than fun.
Level 1, 2 and 3 uses basically the same method, only with slightly different degrees of security. Level 4 is different, but can still be brute-forced. New codes are generated every day for level 4, so do not wait too long to send your message!

To use:
1. Choose a security level, I recommend level 4.
2. Write or paste your message into the box, most characters are supported.
3. Write the key you want to use. The key can include all characters you can use to type a message in. You will need to send this key securely to your recipient.
4. Press "Encrypt" and copy the message that is presented. You might need to use the scrollbar.
5. When you get the encrypted message, follow the same steps as above.

#### Gambler:
Gamble away all your shmeckles (in app currency) with this fantastic applet. More modes will be added soon.

Guesser: Guess the number! If you fail, you lose. but there are some tasty prices if you win!   

Waster: Have too many shmeckles? Using waster you can throw them all away, ten shmeckles at the time!   

Bank: Have too few shmeckles? Now you can borrow some more at the bank! Don't worry about the massive depts you are collecting, i'm sure it will be fine!   

Boring: Yeah, this one's pretty boring.

#### NameGenerator:
Generates som epretty good names for you! This one doesn't need much of an explanation, but here are the different types of names you can generate:

Company names, Robot names, Human names, Country names.

## Installation
To install simply download and uncompress the .zip file. After that, open `Application_suite.exe`.
For updating simply delete all the old files and reinstall. A better system may be developed in the future.

If you find ways of improving my applications, please leave an issue on my github.
